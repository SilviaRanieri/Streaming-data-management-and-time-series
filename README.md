Time series forecasting
# Overview
The aim of this project is to predict the hourly carbon monoxide (CO) values ​​of the univariate time series, the reference period is from 2005-03-01 (hour = 0) to 2005-03-31 (hour = 23). Different algorithms will be used and finally establish: one of the ARIMA family, one of the UCM family, and one of the Machine Learning family. Python was used as a tool. The performance of the models was compared by means of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
